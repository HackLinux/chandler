    retained in Python 2.3 alone or in any derivative version prepared by
    Licensee.

    3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on
    or incorporates Python 2.3 or any part thereof, and wants to make
    the derivative work available to others as provided herein, then
    Licensee hereby agrees to include in any such work a brief summary of

    6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
    breach of its terms and conditions.
