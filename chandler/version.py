# Note:
#
# This file is read and parsed by the distribution
# scripts to determine what the major, minor and 
# release version number is.  It does this in a
# very brute-force manner: it looks for the line
# that starts with "release ="
#
# The same script also appends to the file the
# svn revision # in the following format:
#
# buildRevision = "1234"
#

release = "0.7.m1"
build = "Milestone 0.7.m1"
buildRevision = "0000"
