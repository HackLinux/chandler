To experiment with different python versions
--------------------------------------------

 make _realclean
 change VERSION in external/python/Makefile
 rebuild all binaries since they all depend on python
 review patch file and update patch file target in Makefile


Upgrading python build
----------------------

 review patch file and update patch file target in Makefile
 create patches-$(VERSION) from the previous version and re-evaluate patches

 On Windows:
   - upgrade the vc++ project files to 7.1
      Note: 2.4.1 may already be 7.1 - open them in 7.1 to verify
   - copy them into win32/$(VERSION)
   - edit zlib.vcproj to remove the VCPreLinkEventTool checking for zlib
      Note: ensure you get both instances (debug and release)
   - edit bz2.vcproj to remove the VCPreLinkEventTool checking for bzip2
      Note: ensure you get both instances (debug and release)
   - disable the _bsddb, _ssl, _testcapi, _tkinter, winsound, win9xpopen
     projects 
   - make

 On other OS:
   - make

Deprecated Notes:
  For windows prior to 2.4.3 you also needed to do the following:
   - edit zlib.vcproj to point at zlib 1.2.1 instead of zlib 1.1.4
      Note: 2.4.1 already has this change
   - edit bz2.vcproj to point at bz2 1.0.3 instead of bz2 1.0.2
