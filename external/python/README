To experiment with different python versions
--------------------------------------------

 make _realclean
 change VERSION in external/python/Makefile
 rebuild all binaries since they all depend on python
 review patch file and update patch file target in Makefile


Upgrading python build
----------------------

 On Windows:
   - locate the PCbuild/ directory and the *.vcproj and pcbuild.sln
   - copy them into win32/$(VERSION)
   - copy the previous version's readline.vcproj file into win32/$(VERSION)
   - edit bz2.vcproj to remove the VCPreLinkEventTool checking for bzip2
      Note: ensure you get both instances (debug and release)
   - disable the _bsddb, _ssl, _testcapi, _tkinter, winsound, win9xpopen,
     _ctypes_test, _sqlite3 projects 
   - remember that the patches-2.5.1-Cygwin-readline patches pcbuild.sln directly
      factor that in if you are changing pcbuild.sln to enable/disable a module
   - To enable/disable a module:
       - checkout external/python and do a make expand to get the PCbuild/
          directory populated
       - open MSVC
       - open external/python/Python-2.5.1/PCbuild/pcbuild.sln
       - bring up the build configuration dialog
       - edit the Debug set and the Release set
       - save and exit
       - edit new pcbuild.sln to remove the parts patched by patches-2.5.1-Cygwin-readline

 On Mac:
   - to get Chandler.app to display as 'Chandler' and not 'Python' in the 
     menubar, Python.app's Info.plist and InfoPlist.strings are patched to
     set both CFBundleName and CFBundleDisplayName to 'Chandler'.
     Use diff -ua on InfoPlist.strings to force it to be seen as text.

 On all OSs:
   - review patch files and refresh patches as needed.


Deprecated Notes:
  For windows prior to 2.4.1 you needed to do the following:
   - upgrade the vc++ project files to 7.1
      Note: 2.4.1 may already be 7.1 - open them in 7.1 to verify
  For windows prior to 2.4.3 you also needed to do the following:
   - edit zlib.vcproj to point at zlib 1.2.1 instead of zlib 1.1.4
      Note: 2.4.1 already has this change
   - edit bz2.vcproj to point at bz2 1.0.3 instead of bz2 1.0.2
  For windows prior to 2.5 you also need to do the following:
   - edit zlib.vcproj to remove the VCPreLinkEventTool checking for zlib
      Note: ensure you get both instances (debug and release)

Readline support
----------------

  On Windows:
    - a windows port of GNU readline 5.2 obtained from 
          http://gpsim.sourceforge.net/gpsimWin32/packages/readline-5.2-20061112-src.zip
      is compiled first in external/readline and then statically linked into
      a readline extension module if the python-2.5-Cygwin-readline patch is 
      applied.
      The readline.vcproj project file was cloned from bz2.vcproj.

  On Mac OS X:
    - GNU readline 5.2 is first built in external/readline and is included as 
      a readline extension module if the patches-Darwin-readline patch is 
      applied.

  On Linux:
    - readline is included by default.
